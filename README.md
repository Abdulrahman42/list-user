# Coding Test Solution
🚀 Tech Stack

- Language/Framework: [e.g., TypeScript + React]

- Tools: [e.g., Tailwindcss, Material symbols, React select, React router dom]


📝 Approach

1. Understanding the requirements

  - Reviewed the problem statement and mapped the expected input/output.

  - Designed a project structure that is easy to read and extend.

2. Implementation

  - Broke down the solution into smaller functions/components for reusability and clarity.

  - Added validation and error handling where necessary.

  - Focused on clean code practices and consistency.

3. Testing & Verification

  - Ran multiple scenarios (normal cases, edge cases, error handling).

  - Used console logs/unit tests (if required) to verify the results.


📌 Assumptions

- The Search by username (real-time) requirement means that as the user types in the search field, the filtering happens instantly without needing to press Enter or click a button.

- Since the API endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
 only provides a single route without support for queries or filters, the search and filtering are handled manually on the client side using the retrieved dataset.

- Since the requirements mention displaying Name, the search will be performed against both username and name fields.
